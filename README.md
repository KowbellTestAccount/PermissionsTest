# PermissionsTest

Testing how permissions work with repos controlled by an organization

This line was added by some random account I made. It wasn't able to push it until I added the account as a collaborator with `Write` access.

I then removed the account from being an explicit collaborator and instead added it to an NCSUVGDC Organization Team with write access to the repo. If you're reading this, it was able to push!
